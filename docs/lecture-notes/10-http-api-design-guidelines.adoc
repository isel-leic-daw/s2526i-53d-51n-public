= HTTP API design guidelines

== Introduction

Set of guidelines with recommendations and suggestions for the HTTP design process.

== Ensure the HTTP protocol requirements

The HTTP protocol defines a set of requirements on the defined concepts.
Some examples are:

* The semantics of the HTTP request methods.
* The properties of the HTTP request methods, such as safety and idempotency.
* The semantics of the HTTP response message status codes.
* The semantics of the HTTP request, response, and content headers.

An HTTP API must ensure that those requirements are fulfilled.
Failure to do so may result in incorrect behavior, namely when there are intermediaries involved.

A real production scenario will almost always include intermediaries, between the initial HTTP client and the final HTTP API servers.
Those intermediaries, such as reverse-proxies, assume the requirements are fulfilled and have behavior that assumes them.
As an example, reverse-proxies may retries failed requests that use an idempotent method, such as `PUT`.
If the HTTP API uses `PUT` in a non-idempotent way, such retry may have result in erroneous behavior, such as creation of duplicate resources.

== Take advantage of the HTTP protocol semantic richness

The HTTP protocol defines a set of application-level features that should be used by an HTTP API, when compatible requirements arise.
A important reason is that those feature reflect mature and tested designs, frequently used in the production scenarios.

An obvious feature is the the use of the `GET` method on operations that retrieve resource representations.
While the use of a `POST` method would not violate any HTTP requirements, it would fail to take of an existing feature.

Other examples include:

* The use of the `Accept-*` headers to perform content negotiation, including language negotiation.
** E.g. instead of inventing extra parameters, a client should be able to express the language preferences via the standard `Accept-Language`. 
Similarly, the server should express the chosen language using the `Content-Language` standard header.

* The use of the `Cache-Control` caching headers to express caching requirements by clients and caching properties by servers.
** E.g. an interesting use case are the `stale-while-revalidate` and `stale-while-error` extensions, defined by link:https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5861.html[RFC 5861 - HTTP Cache-Control Extensions for Stale Content].

* The use of the `Authorization` and `WWW-Authenticate` headers to convey or challenge for authentication and authorization information.
** E.g. intermediaries know that an `Authorization` header conveys sensitive information and may automatically remove it from issued logs.

== Identify and respect the limits of HTTP

The HTTP protocol aims to be a generic protocol, without any ties to specific domains.
It is important not to try to force domain specific semantics into HTTP constructs. 
A frequent example is the use of specific HTTP status codes or HTTP headers to reflect domain specific behaviors, which breaks the uniform interface principle.

Most frequently, the proper place to insert domain-specif functionality is in the format used by the representations.
Namely, a significant part of an HTTP API design effort is in the design of representations format.

== Representation format design.

* Take advantage of existing formats, such as link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9457[Problem Details for HTTP APIs].
** See the link:https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml[IANA media type registry].

* When designing JSON-based representations:
** Consider if a new media type should be used or even registered.
** Design for extensibility.
*** Do not use arrays as top-level values.
*** When representing lists consider using directly an array or an object with an `items` property. The latter case allows for adding new information about the _thing_ being described (e.g. length, pagination), without a breaking change.

* Create a vocabulary with the used terms.
