= Servlets

The servlet API (interfaces and base classes) was initially defined by link:https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-ee-glance.html[Java Enterprise Edition] as a way to allow interoperability between 

* server-level software that is responsible for the _network_ layer of HTTP processing, namely socket management and message deserialization and serialization.
* application-level software that is ultimately responsible for consuming the contents of an already deserialized request and produce a response.

Currently, this API is maintained by project link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/[Jakarta].

The HTTP servlet API is based on two main abstract types:

* link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservlet[``HttpServlet``] - responsible for ultimately handling an HTTP request by populating an ``HttpServletResponse`` using information from a ``HttpServletRequest``.

* link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpfilter[``HttpFilter``] - contributes to the handling of HTTP requests, by using the request's information, present in an `HttpServletResponse` instance, and eventually mutating an ``HttpServletResponse`` _before_ and _after_ the request is handled by a server and/or other filters. Multiple filters are organized in a pipeline.

The link:https://eclipse.dev/jetty/[Jetty] and link:https://tomcat.apache.org/[Tomcat] projects provide servers that _implement_ the Servlet API.

The link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc.html[Spring Web MVC] is a project that _uses_ the Servlet API to implement high-level server functionalities, such as routing and request and response binding.
An application using link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc.html[Spring Web MVC] can be seen as a stack where:

* In the bottom layer is a Servlet server, such as Jetty or Tomcat.
* In the middle layer is Spring Web MVC.
* In the upped layer is the specific-application code.

See: link:../../code/jvm/servlet-intro[servlet-intro] code example, namely:

* The ``ExampleServlet`` and ``ExampleFilter``, which are _independent_ of the concrete used server.
* The ``Jetty.kt`` and ``Tomcat.kt`` ``main`` functions that configure a server and register instance of the servlet and filter.
