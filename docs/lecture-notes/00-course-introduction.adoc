= Course Introduction

== Main goal

Provide the students with the knowledge and ability to design and develop HTTP APIs and browser-based applications that use those APIs.

== Short Syllabus

* The Spring framework and server-side software organization.
* HTTP API design.
* Introduction to browser-based applications.
* The TypeScript language.
* The React library for browser-based applications.

== Evaluation

The course final grade is computed from the following two parts:

* 60% - final individual written test, done on the regular exam dates. A minimum grade of 9.5 is required.
* 40% - single project divided into two-phases.

** There will be a grade per project phase, assigned after a final presentation and discussion.
** A minimum grade of 8.0 is required on each project phase.
** The projects are done by groups of 3 students.
** Project delivery is done via the student group Git repository.

The project is divided into two phases:

* Phase 1: design the HTTP API and implement it using the Spring framework.
* Phase 2: create a browser-based application using the API.

Presentations and discussions

* Mid-term presentation of the phase 1 delivery, on week 7.
* Final-term presentation and discussions of the final project delivery, on weeks 14 and 15.
