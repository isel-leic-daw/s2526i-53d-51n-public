= Code organization and tests 

== Goal

This guide aims to improve the understanding of the backend code organization, testing techniques, and automation tasks.

== Steps

=== Setting up the environment

* Checkout the latest commit in the `main` branch of the `s2526i-53d-51n-public` repository.
* Open one or more shells in the `code/jvm/tic-tac-toe` folder.
* Open the `tic-tac-toe` Gradle-based project in Intellij.
    ** Ensure project loading is successful.
* Install link:https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop].
    ** Check that Docker Desktop is running correctly by doing `docker ps`
        *** This command shows the running containers.
* Run `./gradlew dbTestsWait` to start a PostgreSQL instance in a container.
    ** Run `docker ps` to check that now there is a container running.
* Run `./gradlew check` to run all tests.
    ** Ensure the build is successful.
    ** Open the file located at `build/reports/tests/test/index.html` and visualize the tests that were executed and their outcome.
* Run `docker ps`
    ** Running the `check` task terminates the container at the end.

=== Adding tests in the _domain_ group

* Add a test in the _domain_ group.
    ** A `TokenEncoder` implementation is responsible for taking a token and producing validation information that can be stored in the database. Computing the token from this information should be computationally infeasible, however given a token it should be easy to check if the token matches the validation information.
    ** The test should empirically
        *** Verify that the validation information is not equal to the original token.
        *** Verify that the encoding process is deterministic.
    ** Run the test from inside IntelliJ and from the shell.

=== Extend the _repository_ functionality

* Add a new function to the `UserRepository`, which returns the number of tokens for a given user that have been used in a given time interval and created in a given interval.
    ** Implement that function in the `JdbiUserRepository`.
    ** Adds at least one test in `JdbiUserRepositoryTests` to test this new repository functionality.
        *** Ensure the test passes successfully, both when running from inside IntelliJ and from inside the shell.

=== Extend the _services_ functionality

* Add a new function to the `UsersService` interface to obtain the number of valid tokens for a given user.
    ** Note the properties in the `UsersDomainConfig` class, belonging to the _domain_ group.
    ** Add at least one test in the `UsersServiceTests` to verify this new service functionality.
        *** Ensure the test passes successfully, both when running from inside IntelliJ and from inside the shell.

=== Extend the _http_ functionality

* Add to the HTTP API a way to obtain the number of valid tokens for the authenticated user.
    ** Add at least one test in the `UserTests` to verify this new HTTP API functionality.
        *** Observe the use of the `@SpringBootTest` annotation in the `UserTests` class and research what is its purpose.
        *** Observe the use of the `WebTestClient` class in the tests present in `UserTests`.
        *** Ensure the test passes successfully, both when running from inside IntelliJ and from inside the shell.

* Make sure all the tests pass successfully when run from the shell via `./gradlew check`.
